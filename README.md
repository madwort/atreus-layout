My DVORAK layout for keyboardio atreus

* Layer 0 is based on the Keyboardio QWERTY layout, for use with the computer set to Dvorak.
* Layer 4 is based on the Keyboardio Dvorak layout, for use with the computer set to QWERTY. 
  * this is useful for typing Japanese with the computer set to Romaji 
* Keep the shift key on the left hand little finger. 
* Make tab accessible for command-tab to switch applications
* still some kinks to work out
